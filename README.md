## 🧠 Why Privagen?

Organizations today are paralyzed by privacy concerns and data access bottlenecks. Analysts, researchers, and engineers often wait weeks — or are denied access altogether — to datasets that could unlock insights or innovation.

**Privagen solves this by generating safe synthetic data** that preserves the structure, correlations, and statistical patterns of real data — without exposing any sensitive information.
